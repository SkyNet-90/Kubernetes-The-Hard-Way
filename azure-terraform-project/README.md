# Azure Terraform Project

This project contains the Terraform configuration to provision Azure virtual machines and networking resources.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Azure subscription
- Terraform installed on your local machine

## Configuration

The project has the following files:

- `main.tf`: This file contains the main configuration for the Terraform project. It defines the Azure resources to be provisioned, such as virtual machines, networking resources, and any other necessary components.

- `variables.tf`: This file defines the input variables for the Terraform project. It allows you to customize the configuration by providing values for variables such as the number of VMs, VM sizes, and networking details.

- `outputs.tf`: This file defines the output values that will be displayed after the Terraform deployment is complete. It can include information such as the IP addresses of the provisioned VMs or any other relevant details.

- `terraform.tfvars`: This file is used to set the values for the variables defined in `variables.tf`. It allows you to provide specific values for your deployment, such as the Azure subscription ID, resource group name, and other configuration options.

## Usage

To deploy the Terraform configuration, follow these steps:

1. Update the values in `terraform.tfvars` with your specific configuration.

2. Initialize the Terraform project by running the following command:

   ```shell
   terraform init
   ```

3. Preview the changes that will be applied by running the following command:

   ```shell
   terraform plan
   ```

4. If the plan looks good, apply the changes by running the following command:

   ```shell
   terraform apply
   ```

   You will be prompted to confirm the deployment. Enter `yes` to proceed.

5. Wait for the deployment to complete. Once finished, you will see the output values defined in `outputs.tf`.

6. To destroy the provisioned resources, run the following command:

   ```shell
   terraform destroy
   ```

   You will be prompted to confirm the destruction. Enter `yes` to proceed.
